                <strong><small>Why I decided to become a Web Developer</small></strong>
                <p> I decided I wanted to become a Web Developer because of many things. First, I decided I wanted to become a Web Developer because
                    I love to problem-solve. I am very curious and I love to learn new skills involving technology. I also enjoy
                    searching around to finding answers and trying different strategies to create more efficient approaches. Second, I love to create.
                    I've always wanted to be apart of a career that allows me to be creative and brainstorm ideas. Third, technology is always growing which
                    means I will consistently be learning and growing. There are so many different languages to learn and I can choose which ones I enjoy the
                    most and make a career out of it.

                    <p id="background">I graduated from Winthrop University in May 2020. I taught 3rd grade virtually my first year and my second year
                    I taught in the classroom. I had a passion for working with kids but I realized it was a lot more that came with teaching
                    and I wasn't able to spend time with my family and friends, travel, or have time to myself. I knew I wanted more in life for myself so I began
                    researching and looking into other opportunities. I came across the trucking industry
                    and I opened my own business as an Independent Freight Dispatcher. After dispatching for about 10 months I decided I wanted
                    a career that would allow me to be financially stable and something that is more consistent as far as my schedule. I started doing more research and
                    I came across IT. I spent time looking into the different areas of IT and fell I in love with coding. Since then, I've
                    been practicing and continuously learning to help me prepare for the Coding Temple bootcamp.
